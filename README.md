 PROJECT TITLE -C - Binary trees

AUTHOR - NYARKO PHILIP ABEL 'aphilipnyarko@gmail.com'

PROJECT PREVIEW:
A binary tree in C is a data structure in which every node can have a maximum of two children nodes. Each node in the binary tree contains a data variable with some value and two pointers pointing to the children. The height of a binary tree is calculated by taking the longest path between the root and the leaf node
